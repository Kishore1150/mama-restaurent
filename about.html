    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>To know about Mama's Kitchen</h3>
    <p>At the point when <b>‘Mamas's Kitchen’</b>  organizer Kishore ventured off the shorelines of Oahu following multi-day of surfing with his Navy pals in the mid-60s, he did what worked out easily for him. He went hunting down 
        a delicious burger, a hot container of fries, and a virus drink.</p>
        <p>After twenty years, in 1982, it was that feeling of peace and fulfillment 
            he was attempting to reproduce when he took a little piece of the ‘Mama's Kichen’s and 
            thudded it down right in the territory of Southern California.</p>
            <p>
                Today, ‘Mama's Kitchen’ still is consistent with Kishore's unique experience and his unique vision.
                 Also, however, our menu has developed to incorporate plates of mixed greens, soups, and delicate tacos.
            </p>
            <p>Despite everything we hold fast to the fundamental rationality that new sustenance, well-disposed administration, and a 
                laid-back air is the ideal end to a hard day of work or play. We trust you taste it in each chomp.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we trust that whether you’re a ravenous surfer or occupied salesman, you stroll into Mama's Kichen s and state to yourself, as Tony did those 
                    numerous years back, “Ahh…this is the place I need to be.”</p>
